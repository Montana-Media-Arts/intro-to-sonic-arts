## Final Draft Revisions

Please take any comments provided from your first draft and incorporate them as you iterate your art work for the final version. You are expected to reassess your work, consider whether it is accomplishing what you want it to accomplish, and push it further than what you submitted for the first draft. Please take this time to really dig in and create a piece that you feel proud about.

As always, if you are having problems of have questions, please reach out to myself or the TA.

If you have questions about the final project specification expectations, please refer to [last weeks page.]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/week-12/final-project/)
