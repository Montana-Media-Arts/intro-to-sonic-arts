One of the qualities that defines a sonic event is it's (and your) relationship to space. When we talk about **space**, we may be referring to where a sound is occurring, how large or small of a space the sound is occurring in, the acoustic qualities of the materials in the space, and so on.

These qualities that help determine a sound's relationship to space give listeners a sense of where a sound is. Likewise, space or a sound's relationship to space also influences how we perceive the relationships between multiple sonic events in space.
