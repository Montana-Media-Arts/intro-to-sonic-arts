This semester has been wonderful. As a new instructor for Dean Musick's online course, "Fundamentals of Sound Production & Design" in the School of Visual and Media Arts, I've thoroughly enjoyed working with everyone. Together, we've covered a lot of ground, introducing you to the basic properties of sound, audio technology, and its relationship to people. We've discussed historical figures, artists, and musicians who have contributed to the field of audio technology, as well as the concepts and techniques that constitute sound engineering and sound design. You've also been introduced to tools and techniques for capturing, creating, manipulating, and producing sonically designed art, including Digital Audio Workstations, basic recording techniques, mixing skills, critical listening, signal processing, plug-ins, synthesis, and MIDI. This course admittedly covers a lot of topics and knowledge.

You've worked hard to acquire new skills, knowledge, and techniques, and I hope this sparks an interest in continuing to work with sound production & design. Whether you pursue sound as a sonic artist, electronic musician, avant-garde artist, recording/mix engineer, sound designer for film, sound designer or composer for video games, live sound reinforcement, or as a sound-based researcher, I'm here to support your ongoing work.

I'm incredibly proud of all of you, and I hope you are too. This is not an easy course, especially for those who have never worked with a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). The importance of sound is often overlooked. As you continue to create media art, remember that sound can enhance your work or distract from the overall creation you intend to make.

Even if sound is not your primary focus in your studies or career, having this knowledge and skillset will help you stand out in many of your artistic endeavors. You are now budding audio engineers, and I think that's pretty impressive. I can't wait to see the media art you will inevitably create here at the University and beyond.
