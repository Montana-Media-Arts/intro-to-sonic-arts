**Due: {{site.data.dates.1st_draft}}**

Building on all of the diverse and extensive work that you have engaged in over the course of this semester, you are expected to create a final sonic art work for this course.



# Final Project Specs

## Originality

The intent of this final project is for you to create an original sonic art work. Please use this as an opportunity to be creative, and to explore something that you have found interesting throughout this course.

Unless we directly asked you to change something from your Final Project Proposal, you should have been working on the final project as you proposed.

## Deadlines

- Final Project Deadline:
	- Your final project will have two deadlines, a 1st draft, and a final version. We will make comments and provide feedback after the first draft, and you will be expected to make appropriate adjustments and resubmit by the final version submission deadline.
		- 1st draft deadline: **{{ site.data.dates.1st_draft}}**
		- Final Version Deadline: **{{ site.data.dates.final_submission}}**
			- Please note: I will need to spend Wednesday during the day preparing your works for radio presentation that evening. As such, we CANNOT ACCEPT ANY LATE WORK FOR THIS DEADLINE. Failure to submit on time will result in a failing grade for the course.
	- This will allow me and the TA's to listen to each piece, to ensure that it is radio appropriate.
	- Likewise, I will be mastering all of your final works, so that they are at the appropriate loudness levels and sound like they "belong together".
- Final Project Proposal:


## Presentational Format

As we are planning on radio presentations, there are a number of factors for the final format for you to consider.

- Length:
	- 1 - 4 minutes.
	- Your final project can be anywhere between 1 and 4 minutes long.
- Copyright Material:
	- You must have all copyright for your work.
	- Since this will be broadcast on the radio, you must ensure that all source material and all aspects of the work are your own work
	- OR contain material that have copyrights allowing for re-use and distribution.
	- In other words, do not use any copyright material where you can not guarantee you are allowed to present it publicly.
- No Obscene, Profane, or Indecent material
	- You are not allowed to create works that contain obscene, profane, or indecent material.
		- For more on this, please read: [Obscene, Indecent and Profane Broadcasts - Federal Communications Commission](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/obscene-indecent-and-profane-broadcasts)
	- This also means you must refrain from the "seven dirty words" and related terminology.



## Technical Specifications

For this work, you need to adhere to or accomplish the following technical specifications;

1. **Final File Type** - This work should be exported as a stereo, digital audio file (`.wav.` or `.aiff`), with a sample rate of 441.kHz or 48kHz, and a bit depth of 24bits.
2. **Time Requirements** - Your final work should be between 1:00 and 4:00 minutes.
3. **Work Investment** - Since this is a final project, you should plan to invest approximately 2 weeks worth of a normal homework assignment times requirement. I.E. if it normally takes you 3-6 hours to complete a homework assignment for this course, you should plan on a final project that you think will take you between 6-12 work hours.
4. **Final Amplitude Levels** - You should ensure that your final audio file contains no clipping or amplitude overages (i.e. amplitude or peaks above $$0.0dBFS$$). Ideally, you should aim to have a file with an amplitude peak of $$-1.0dBFS$$.

## Deliverables

In addition to a digital audio file (as mentioned above) which constitutes the actual sonic art work, you will need to supply a number of additional materials.

- A 1-2 page discussion about this work. Please write about;
	- **A brief (1-4 sentence) description of your work** that would be appropriate to read on air (if time allows).
	- The name of your work
	- The name you want to be represented with for your work
	- Additionally, I would like a longer discussion of;
		- what you were working to accomplish with this work
		- what techniques, concepts, or artistic styles you decided to build on from this semester
		- finally, I would like you to also discuss briefly what skills or techniques you feel like you wanted to covered this semester that we did not get to
- 2-3 Images of your Reaper session.
- Your _bounced_ stereo audio file
- _[OPTIONAL]_ You are also welcome to additionally submit the above 1-4 sentence description of your work as an audio recording. If you do this, and time allows, I will have that played on the radio, so that you can introduce your work.


## Submission

Please, upload your final versions to Moodle by the posted deadline!

## Classmate Responses

In addition to submitting your own final project, you will be expected to listen to the _Something Else_ show in order to reflect upon the entire classes projects. More info to come on this closer to the show itself.
