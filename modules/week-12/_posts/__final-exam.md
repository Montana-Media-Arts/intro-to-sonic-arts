**Update: There will be no final exam for MART 330 - Principles of Sound Design**

For the Spring 2021 semester, there will be NO final exam for this course. Instead, the grade weighting will increase for the final project to $$25\%$$. This is up from $$15\%$$, adding in the $$10\%$$ that was originally assigned to the final exam.

PLEASE TAKE THE EXTRA TIME TO INSTEAD WORK ON YOUR FINAL PROJECT.
