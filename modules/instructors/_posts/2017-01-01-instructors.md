## [Kate Lloyd)

Instructor Bio: My name is Kate Lloyd, and I am a third-year graduate student in the Media Arts department. I have over 15 years of experience working in the performing arts: as a touring musician, stagecraft for theater, field recordist and sound designer for film, a foley artist for live broadcasting, and a technical director. I've also served as an audio/lighting engineer for live music production venues.

I have served as the production manager and recording/mixing engineer for the University Graduate School Podcast, "Confluence," where I also specialized in soundscapes and sound design.

Current Work & Research @ UM: My current research interests include sound for games, immersive audio, VR/AR and avian sound
I currently serve as the Sound Studio Manager and assistant to the media equipment room.

Dr. Michael Musick built this course, which is maintained by Kate Lloyd. Please contact Kate Lloyd with any problems.

#### Office Hours
**In-Person:**

I encourage you to send me an email indicating what questions you would like to address and so I can block out time based on your needs.

## Teaching Assistant/s

In addition to myself, we will be supported with two teaching assistants this semester.

If you are unable to solve problems on your own or through the course Canvas forum (more to come on that later), you should e-mail a TA for help.
