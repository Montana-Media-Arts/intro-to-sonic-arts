Dr. Michael Musick built this course, which is maintained by Kate Lloyd. Please contact Kate Lloyd with any problems.

## [Instructor Bio)
- Instructor Bio: My name is Kate Lloyd, and I am a second-year graduate student in the Media Arts department. I have over 15 years of experience working in the performing arts: as a touring musician, stagecraft for theater, field recordist and sound designer for film, a foley artist for live broadcasting, and a technical director. I've also served as an audio/lighting engineer for live music production venues.
Current Work & Research @ UM: I currently serve as the Sound Studio Manager and assistant to the media equipment room.
Last fall, I was the production manager and recording/mixing engineer for the University Graduate School Podcast, "Confluence," where I also specialized in soundscapes for sound design.
My current research interests include sound for games, immersive audio, and mobile applications for mental health.
