## Teaching Assistant/s

In addition to myself, we will be supported with teaching assistants this semester.

If you are unable to solve problems on your own or through the course Moodle forum (more to come on that later), you should e-mail a TA for help.

Additionally, the TA will be available for video meetings and face-to-face meetings to assist with problems. Please set these appointments up individually with the TA.
