When you have problems in this course, you have a number of solutions available to assist you in solving them. The following list is the order I would suggest you follow for problem solving.

1. Google the problem.
    - A critical skill in creative technology and media art is learning to problem solve. Part of this involves learning how to form a good google query. Your first go to for help should always be google.
2. **Post a discussion to the [_Course Help Forum_ in Moodle](https://moodle.umt.edu/mod/hsuforum/view.php?id=1951688).**
3. **Get help from our Graduate Teaching Assistant**;
    - [Kate Lloyd](mailto:kate.lloyd@umconnect.umt.ede)
    - [Matthew Knight](mailto:matthew.knight@umconnect.umt.edu)
4. Get help from the professor [Ryan Weibush]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/)
    - If you have a problem, or need help that no one can offer, please contact Michael Musick.
    - You may also email me to schedule an appt.. (I will check my email at least once a day)
