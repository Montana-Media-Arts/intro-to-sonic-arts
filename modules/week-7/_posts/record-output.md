With the tone generator, filter, and delay, you can begin to treat Reaper as a pseudo-instrument, creating complex sounds within a track.

One workflow you may find yourself wanting is the ability to record the output from a track, in order to;

- iterate through ideas
- develop a sound element by element
- record output sounds and work with them as their own material
- capture the emergent output of playing, to select the best moments.

In order to record the results of the insert FX within a track in Reaper, we will need to send that track to another track.

Generally, this is called **_bussing_**. An audio bus takes sound from one place, and "busses" that sound to another place. A bus can include the audio from a single location, or can mix together audio from multiple locations/tracks. Bussing is essentially a form of signal routing.

There are two ways of bussing in Reaper; "Folder Tracks" and "Sends".

## Folder Tracks

A folder track is like a directory folder on a computer, it is a collection of tracks, controlled by a parent (track).

## Sends

A send takes the output from one track and "busses" it to another track. What is important to remember
