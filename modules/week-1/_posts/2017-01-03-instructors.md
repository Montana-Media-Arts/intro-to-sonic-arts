## Michael Musick

Welcome to MART 245: Sound Production & Design
I am delighted to inform you that while this course was originally designed by Dr. Michael Musick, I, Kate Lloyd, am now the instructor of record. Dr. Musick has taken on the role of acting Dean for the School of Visual and Media Arts.
As your instructor, I am your primary point of contact for any significant issues, whether they are administrative or technical in nature. I encourage you to approach me with any concerns or questions you may have.
I am genuinely excited to work with each of you and guide you on your journey through the world of Sound Production & Design. This course promises to be an enriching experience, introducing you to the fundamentals and intricacies of sound in media.

I strongly encourage you to take advantage of the live study hall sessions. These sessions are a valuable opportunity for hands-on learning and direct support with your projects. This will be a chance for us to meet, discuss any individual learning needs, and delve into the course material together. Details about the study hall sessions, including scheduling and how to participate, will be announced once we have figured out a time that best meets everyoneâ€™s schedule.

For those who wish to set up an appointment immediately, please feel free to  arrange an in-person or Zoom meeting during my office hours.

For those eager to set up an appointment right away, you are more than welcome to visit during my in-person office hours or arrange a Zoom meeting at your convenience. If possible, please send me an email before hand, outlining technical issues you wish to trouble shoot.  

Looking forward to an exciting and productive semester with all of you!

> # Bio

Kate Lloyd is a second-year graduate student in the Media Arts department. I have over 15 years of experience working in the performing arts: as a touring musician, stagecraft for theater, field recordist and sound designer for film, a foley artist for live broadcasting, and a technical director. I've also served as an audio/lighting engineer for live music production venues.

Current Work & Research @ UM: I currently serve as the Sound Studio Manager and assistant to the media equipment room.

Last fall, I was the production manager and recording/mixing engineer for the University Graduate School Podcast, "Confluence," where I also specialized in soundscapes for sound design.
My current research interests include sound for games, immersive audio, and mobile applications for mental health.

## Teaching Assistants

In addition to myself, we will be supported with a teaching assistant this semester.

If you are unable to solve problems on your own or through the course Moodle forum (more to come on that later), you should e-mail a TA for help.
