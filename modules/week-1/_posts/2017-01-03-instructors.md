Welcome to MART 245: Sound Production & Design
I am genuinely excited to work with each of you and guide you on your journey through the world of Sound Production & Design. This course promises to be an enriching experience, introducing you to the fundamentals and intricacies of sound in media.

<!--

I strongly encourage you to take advantage of the live study hall sessions. These sessions are a valuable opportunity for hands-on learning and direct support with your projects. This will be a chance for us to meet, discuss any individual learning needs, and delve into the course material together. Details about the study hall sessions, including scheduling and how to participate, will be announced once we have figured out a time that best meets everyoneâ€™s schedule.

For those eager to set up an appointment right away, you are more than welcome to visit during my office hours or arrange a Zoom meeting at your convenience. If possible, please send me an email before hand, outlining technical issues you wish to trouble shoot. --> 

Looking forward to an exciting and productive semester with all of you!

## Teaching Assistants

In addition to myself, we will be supported with a teaching assistant this semester.

If you are unable to solve problems on your own or through the course Moodle forum (more to come on that later), you should e-mail a TA for help.
