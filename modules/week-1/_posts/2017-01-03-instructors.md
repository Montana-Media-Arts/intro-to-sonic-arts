Quick links, including email links, office hours, and lab hours, are all available from the ["Instructors"]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/) tab above in the course menubar.

What follows is a more detailed introduction to the people delivering this class to you this semester. We are a team, and will be working together to deliver this experience to you.

## Ryan Weibush

## Michael Musick

This course was disigned by Dr. Michael Musick. However, he is on leave this semester and I am happily the instructor of record. If you have any significant problems, administrative or technical, you will need to come to me about them.

I am excited to work with you, and guide you through the journey introducing you to sonic art!

Please feel free to leverage my in-person or virtual office hours. I would love it if each and everyone of you would create an appointment to meet with me in the first few weeks to introduce yourself. Although I do not have an office on campus, I am happy to meet in the UC or Library, just email me.  I'm also available via Zoom. 

For anyone wanting to setup an appointment immediately, please feel free to stop by my in person office hours, or setup a Zoom meeting right now!

## Teaching Assistants

In addition to myself, we will be supported with a teaching assistant this semester.

If you are unable to solve problems on your own or through the course Moodle forum (more to come on that later), you should e-mail a TA for help.

- [kate.lloyd@umconnect.umt.edu]
- [matthew.knight@umconnect.umt.edu]

Additionally, these TAs will be available for video meetings to assist with problems.
