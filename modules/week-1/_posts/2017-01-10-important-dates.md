Although this is an asynchronous class, there are a number of dates I want you to be aware of. These are semester specific dates you are expected to be available for as part of your final grade and relating to the unique qualities of this term.


# Final Project Presentations

For the in-person version of this course, the end of the semester is marked by a public concert in which students present their final sonic artworks from the semester. Obviously, an in-person concert is not possible for the format of this course. Therefore, instead, the class will culminate with a radio festival presentation of your works.

We are currently planning for this to occur via KBGA Missoula 89.9FM, College Radio

With Bill Kautz "Something Else!" live Wednesdays 8-10pm(MT) & streaming at kbga.org. 
Creative and Free Music.


## Final Presentation Dates 

TBD, I will be updating this in the next few weeks

<!--

We are planning on presenting your work on:

Wednesday, May 1st. This means your final mix is due April 29th. I will be mastering all of your works together into a playlist and normalizing levels on Tuesday. Therefore if your work is late, the radio show will not wait.

- Wednesday, December 6th (with a due date of Monday, December 4th)

You are **expected to be available during this day, from 8-10pm**. As part of these presentations, we will have you all on the online chat, interacting with each other. 
There will be a recording if you cannot attend but keep in mind, the recording will not do justice to your piece, and thus effect your final response.

**{ NOTE: }** All final project assignments will be due at the same time, likely, December 4th.
