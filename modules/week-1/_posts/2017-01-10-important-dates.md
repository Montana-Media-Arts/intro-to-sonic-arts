Although this is an asynchronous, fully remote class, there are a number of dates I want you to be aware of. These are semester specific dates you are expected to be available for as part of your final grade and relating to the unique qualities of this term.


# Final Project Presentations

For the in-person version of this course, the end of the semester is marked by a public concert in which students present their final sonic artworks from the semester. Obviously, an in-person concert is not possible for the format of this course. Therefore, instead, the class will culminate with a radio festival presentation of your works.

We are currently planning for this to occur via KBGA FM 89.9

## Final Presentation Dates

We are planning on presenting your work on:

- Wednesday, May 10th

You are **expected to be available during this day, from 8-10pm**. As part of these presentations, we will have you all on the online chat, interacting with each other.

**{ NOTE: }** All final project assignments will be due at the same time, likely, May 9th.
