Although this is an asynchronous, fully remote class, there are a number of dates I want you to be aware of. These are semester specific dates you are expected to be available for as part of your final grade and relating to the unique qualities of this term.


# Final Project Presentations

For the in-person version of this course, the end of the semester is marked by a public concert in which students present their final sonic artworks from the semester. Obviously, an in-person concert is not possible for the format of this course, nor in the times of COVID. Therefore, instead, the class will culminate with a radio festival presentation of your works.

We are currently planning for this to occur on Billy Kautz's show, "Something Else" on KBGA over the course of two weeks in April. If you don't already, you should obviously listen to [KBGA](https://www.kbga.org). Billy's show occurs on Wednesday evenings from 8-10pm. This show highlights experimental, avant-garde, electro-acoustic, jazz, creative music, and sonic art. For more information about this show, Billy, to see playlists from the show, or to hear old interviews conducted by Billy head to the following links:
