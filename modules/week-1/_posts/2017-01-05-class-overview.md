Now that you have gone through the syllabus, along with its technical details and policies, let's talk about what this course will actually look like.

## Content

There will be a lot of reading, viewing, and listening.  But I will also supplement the course with optional synchronous lectures to help guide and aid along the way. I recognize that this is not easy stuff.  Don't worry! We will get through this together, even online!

With specific respect to videos; I will post videos of myself explaining topics, as well as videos of any synchronous lectures. I will also supplement these with videos by other practitioners and teachers. These serve to offer varying view points, clear explanations, and a break from you seeing my face all the time.


## Pace

This course takes time. Some things might be easier than others.  However, we will ramp into the course slowly over the next few weeks. But, you should set aside time now in your schedule for course work.

This week is a chance for you to get familiarize yourself with tools on your computer, absorb the syllabus, and schedule out time in your week for class work.


## Dates & Weekly Flow

This course will _mostly_ run as weekly modules.

When a module is released (i.e., it goes live on Canvas and this site), you will have one week to work through it, complete the homework, and submit your homework. Your homework will always be due by 11:59 PM on Canvas <!-- {{ site.data.course.module-week-day }} --> of the next week.  Please don't wait until 11:59 PM to submit your homework.  Everyone tries and the Canvas might be on hiatus and then sad things can happen.
<!--
For example, Week 2's Module runs from January 27th through Feburary 3rd 
 {{ site.data.course.module-week-day }} to {{ site.data.course.module-week-day }}, {{ site.data.dates[2][0] }}  
Therefore, you have one week through next {{ site.data.course.module-week-day }}, {{ site.data.dates[2][1] }} --> to complete the module and to submit your homework. <!-- Week 3 will likewise open {{ site.data.course.module-week-day }} and run {{ site.data.dates[3][0] }} -->


## Homework

You should consider anything within the course lecture content under a **_{ TODO: }_** section to be part of your "homework".

You will receive additional directives and notes about homework assignments on the Canvas Shell every week.

Most homework assignments will be submitted to a course discussion forum on Canvas. This will allow you and your classmates to see each others assignments, as well as how you each chose to solve the set of problems, without posting links for the whole world to see. You will also be expect to comment and respond to your colleagues works. I think it is critical that you are aware of the work each other is making. This is my current solution to address this need. Further instructions will be provided about how to do this.


## Your Organization

I would encourage you to create a directory (folder) on your local machine, within your cloud-based, [Box-sync](http://www.umt.edu/it/support/box/) or [Microsoft OneDrive](https://umt.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2032/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=45894) directory (folder).

> **_{ Note: }_**
>
> As a University of Montana Student, you have access to two cloud-based storage solutions. You receive 1TB of storage with both [Box](http://www.umt.edu/it/support/box/) and [Microsoft Office 365's OneDrive](https://umt.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2032/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=45894).
>
> Both of these tools allow you to download an application that creates a local directory (folder) that automatically syncs its contents to the cloud. By storing your work for this class in there, you are;
> - Less likely to experience data loss
> - Will have all of your data available anywhere you may need, so long as you have an internet connection.
>
> I would highly encourage you to use these one of these tools for all of your UM work.





## Getting Help

When you have problems in this course, you have a number of solutions available to assist you in solving them. The following list is the order I would suggest you follow for problem solving.

1. Google the problem.
    - A critical skill in creative technology and media art is learning to problem solve. Part of this involves learning how to form a good google query. Your first go to for help should always be google.
2. Post a discussion to the "Course help forum" on Canvas.
   <!-- [**Course Help Forum** in Moodle](https://moodle.umt.edu/mod/hsuforum/view.php?id=2655589).
   -->


<!--
[Course Forum in Moodle](https://discord.gg/nbVCKwX)

 Discord is like a massive chat where everyone can talk to one another in real time and help each other out with issues or just chat.
3. Post to the [course issues forum](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/441-WebTech-Spring2020-examples/issues).

    - In a couple pages, you will follow along with a short tutorial that will help you signup for GitHub, then star and follow the "course repository". Part of this repository is an "issues forum" where you can post questions and problems you are having. These "issues" will be e-mailed to you, and you can then respond to them.
    - The advantage to the GitHub issues forum is its advanced system for including formatted code. This will help with problem solving.
