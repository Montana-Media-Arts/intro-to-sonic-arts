This class is designed and has been developed so that you can complete each week's content at your own pace, over the course of a full week. In other words, since this is an online and asynchronous class, you are not required to be present for any real-time class sessions, in-person or via Zoom.

That being said, many of you likely learn better when you can meet synchronously. This allows you to hear updates and content from me in real-time, ask questions, interact with each other, and participate in a more "traditional" course setting. Therefore, I intend to hold a once weekly Zoom meeting.

This synchronous Zoom-based class meeting is an opportunity for you to participate in this class through a more traditional approach. However, since this course is a .50 section, this is an entirely optional experience, and is by no means required. Likewise, since this is something I setup independent of general course schedules, I know there is no way of picking a time you all can attend. For those of you who would want to attend this meeting, who are unable due to previously scheduled engagements, I do apologize.

Currently, I am planning for optional Zoom-based lectures to occur on Wednesday's from 10:30-noon.

The link for this meeting will be on the front page of the courses Moodle shell.

**All of you are welcome to attend these meetings, and I would truly enjoy having you there.** However, it is optional and will not effect you ability to complete the course if you cannot make it or do not want to make it.
