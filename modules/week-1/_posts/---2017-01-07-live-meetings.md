This class is designed and has been developed so that you can complete each week's content at your own pace, over the course of a full week. In other words, since this is an online and asynchronous class, you are not required to be present for any real-time class sessions, in-person or via Zoom.

That being said, many of you likely learn better when you can meet synchronously. This allows you to hear updates and content from me in real-time, ask questions, interact with each other, and participate in a more "traditional" course setting. Therefore, I intend to hold a once weekly in person studdy session in McGill Hall in the computer lab located on the first floor.

This in person class meeting is an opportunity for you to participate in this class through a more traditional approach. However, since this course is a .50 section, this is an entirely optional experience, and is by no means required. Likewise, since this is something I setup independent of general course schedules, I know there is no way of picking a time you all can attend. For those of you who would want to attend this meeting, who are unable due to previously scheduled engagements, I do apologize.

Currently, I am planning for optional in calss lectures to occur on Sunday's from 3:00 PM- 6:00 PM, however this is subject to change.

Once the meeting time is confirmed I will post the days and time on the moodle page.

**All of you are welcome to attend these meetings, and I would truly enjoy having you there.** However, it is optional and will not effect you ability to complete the course if you cannot make it or do not want to make it.
